406. Queue Reconstruction by Height

Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described
by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number
of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write
an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

Note:
The number of people is less than 1,100.

Example

Input:
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]

Output:
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]

================================================================================
SOLUTION

1. Brute-force, greedy.

VALUE COMPARISON involved, consider the ORDERING / MONOTONICITY and EXTREMUM.

2. Insertion sort - backward induction
Process the list in a descending height order.
Add the elements into the result array. Then each element already in the result
array is greater than or equal to the current one to insert.

In another word, for current (h, k), k is the position to insert it!

Complexity: O(nÂ²), O(n)

3. Optimizing inserting with order statistics tree

To enable O(logn) insert, we can augment a balanced binary search tree
as order statistics tree.

But the implementation is absolutely nontrivial.

Complexity: O(nlogn), O(n)

4. Optimization on the sorting process?

Complexity: O(nlogn)

        Because in tuple (h, k), k is only affected by people in front of him that are of
        greater or equal height, inserting people with smaller height won't interfere its
        validity. Then we can reconstruct the queue in a descending order of height to reduce
        the time complexity when finding the next person to insert.
