You are given an integer array nums and you have to return a new counts array.
The counts array has the property where counts[i] is the number of smaller
elements to the right of nums[i].

Example:

Given nums = [5, 2, 6, 1]

To the right of 5 there are 2 smaller elements (2 and 1).
To the right of 2 there is only 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 6 there is 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 1 there is 0 smaller element.
Return the array [2, 1, 1, 0].

==============================================================================================
SOLUTION
    The count of smaller numbers after self is exactly the number of elements move to its left
in a STABLE SORT.

1. Brute force. for each element, count the smaller numbers after self.
Complexity: O(NÂ²)

2. Insert sort with binary search. Inserting SORT from right to left with binary search,
then the inserting index of current element is the smaller numbers after self.
Complexity: O(NlogN) ?

3. Merge sort

4. Segment tree

5. Binary indexed tree

WRAP-UP
    Problems involved with COMPARING VALUES are naturally connected to SORTING process.
