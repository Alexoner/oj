55. Jump Game

Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first
index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

For example:
A = [2,3,1,1,4], return true.

A = [3,2,1,0,4], return false.
===============================================================================================
SOLUTION:
    1. Treat it as a Graph problem, time limit exceeded
    2. Greedy strategy. In a bottom-up manner, update the furthest index that we can reach by
jumping.

        Another form of BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH, with no frontier structure because the graph is
        presented as a list. A single range variable could work as the indicator of exploration
        frontier.

        Then we can sweep the list once, step by step, maintaining a BOUNDARY VARIABLE at each step.
        This boundary variable `furthest` do the trick of SEARCH FRONTIER.
