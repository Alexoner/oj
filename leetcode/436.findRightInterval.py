436. Find Right Interval
Medium

Given a set of intervals, for each of the interval i, check if there exists an interval j whose start point is bigger than or equal to the end point of the interval i, which can be called that j is on the "right" of i.

For any interval i, you need to store the minimum interval j's index, which means that the interval j has the minimum start point to build the "right" relationship for interval i. If the interval j doesn't exist, store -1 for the interval i. Finally, you need output the stored value of each interval as an array.

Note:
You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
You may assume none of these intervals have the same start point.
Example 1:
Input: [ [1,2] ]

Output: [-1]

Explanation: There is only one interval in the collection, so it outputs -1.
Example 2:
Input: [ [3,4], [2,3], [1,2] ]

Output: [-1, 0, 1]

Explanation: There is no satisfied "right" interval for [3,4].
For [2,3], the interval [3,4] has minimum-"right" start point;
For [1,2], the interval [2,3] has minimum-"right" start point.
Example 3:
Input: [ [1,4], [2,3], [3,4] ]

Output: [-1, 2, -1]

Explanation: There is no satisfied "right" interval for [1,4] and [3,4].
For [2,3], the interval [3,4] has minimum-"right" start point.

================================================================================
SOLUTION

1. Brute force

For each interval, enumerate and find the minimum index.

Complexity: O(NÂ²)

2. Sort and binary search

Sort the indices array using key (interval start, index).

And use binary search to search lower bound.

Complexity: O(nlogn)


3. Binary search tree map
TODO: maybe use builtin bisect module.
This is language specific. For c++, is map. Use bst map to store <interval start, index>
