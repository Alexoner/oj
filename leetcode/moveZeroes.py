Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while
maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

For example, given nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12], after calling your function, nums
should be [1, 3, 12, 0, 0].

Note:
- You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
- Minimize the total number of operations.

==============================================================================================
SOLUTION

Minimizing the total number of operations is actually minimizing the time complexity.

1. Brute force method.
Move zeroes to the end one by one like in bubble sort procedure.

Time complexity: O(NÂ²).

2. TWO POINTERS(quick sort partition, Dutch National Flag problem).

This partition situation resembles what's used in the quick sort: use a division point to
divide the data. But quick sort partition uses swap, which will violate the original order.

Use two pointers p and q.
Pointer p indicating the BOUNDARY(DIVISION POINT) where the left part are non-zero
elements, and the other pointer q keeps track of the first non-zero element after p.
Then swap the element at p and q, and update p = p + 1, q = q + 1.

The core idea is to move all non-zero elements in the front of the array.

To minimize the total number of operations, avoid swapping if p == q.
