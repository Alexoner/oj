46. Permutations

Given a collection of distinct numbers, return all possible permutations.

For example,
[1,2,3] have the following permutations:
[
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3,2],
  [2,1,3],
  [2,3,1],
  [3,1,2],
  [3,2,1]
]

Follow up: with duplicate elements? Like 1,1,2, 2,3,2, ...
    Solution: while checking validation, count in an element's maximum appearance times

Follow up: arrangements of m of n numbers. ( m <= n)

==============================================================================================
SOLUTION:

For a general partial permutation problem, we have several ways to define STATES, thus giving
several approaches.

1. Dynamic Programming

Define the state f[n, k] as number of PARTIAL ARRANGEMENTS of k given n, then explore the
RECURRENCE RELATION.

The structure of this problem resembles the 0-1 knapsack problem.
We have recurrence relation state transition:
  f[n, k] = #arrangements containing mth number + #arrangements not with mth number
          = f[n - 1, k - 1] * k + f[n - 1, k],

For a special case, full permutation, we have
  f[n, n] = n * f[n - 1, n - 1] + 0 = n * f[n - 1, n - 1]

2. Dynamic GRAPH: dfs/bfs
Use BACKTRACKING with DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH or Breadth First Search.

A Dynamic Graph is a graph with dynamic vertices or edges/connectivity.

Vertices are partial states, representing the partial permutations. And connectivity is
represented by edges, which correspond to state transition/recurrence relation.

For each vertex, there are many different branches to follow, leading to another
vertex/state/permutation. To find all eligible permutations, traverse the graph from
vertices of shorter permutations to longer ones. This is actually growing the partial
permutations

With dfs, one connection/edge will be cut when following this edge so that isn't available.
But we are done searching the subgraph, it will be available to other paths. Thus it's a
backtracking scenario: we need to restore those states after a dfs subroutine returns.
Also, we can pass copies of states/edges, instead of modifying 1 copy of states/edges,
so that we have separate sets of edges at each vertex of the dynamic graph, thus avoiding
backtracking.

In this dynamic graph, the VERTICES are PARTIAL PERMUTATIONS, and the EDGES are distinct
numbers. We generate the permutations by adding numbers one by one to transit from one
vertex to another through an edge.

Define the state f(k) as a partial arrangement of k numbers, where k = 0, 1, ..., K.
Then there always exists such transition from f(k - 1) that

    f(k) = f(k - 1) + [available/non-duplicate number].

In another word, f(k -1) is of the first k - 1 elements in f(k).

Then the graph traversal process is like this:
    Fill the K slots/positions one by one, at each step/depth, we have multiple edges/branches.
Each partial permutation is a VERTEX state, and each available candidate number forms
an EDGE connection.

Both dfs/bfs will do the job.

To sum it up, we have to search algorithms: dfs and bfs. For dfs, we can:
    1) Pass copies of states
    2) Pass indices, for states represented with large objects
    2) Backtrack: mutate state in place, do dfs, restore when dfs subroutine returns.

3. Generative method: Lexicographical order next permutation
Define the state as one possible partial permutation of K numbers. At each step, find
the next Lexicographically larger permutation.

The algorithm minimizes movement:
  generates each permutation from the previous one by interchanging a single pair of elements;
the other nâˆ’0 elements are not disturbed

==============================================================================================
RECURSIVE CALL TO ITERATIVE

To convert recursive depth-first search call to iterative, we have two
difference implementations.

1. ADAPT BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH process.

Change the search FRONTIER behaviour from QUEUE to STACK, and the rest
is the same with BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH. We PUSH states into the search
frontier, and pop them out, then explore adjacent vertices(states). In
this way, we are pushing all adjacent vertices at the same time.

2. EMULATE THE RECURSIVE CALL mechanism with STACK.

We gather the state composed of:
    function INPUT PARAMETER, LOCAL VARIABLES, RETURN VALUE
in the RECURSIVE PROCEDURE and store them as STACK FRAME.

Operate on the stack, at each frame, we determine whether to PUSH a new frame or POP out
an existing frame that has already been finished exploring.

Then general algorithm procedure skeleton for this would be
1) PUSH state until some condition(STOP CRITERION)
2) POP state for CONDITION of STOP CRITERION, RESTORING states to backtrack. Those
STOP CRITERIA correspond to the regions where the recursive dfs procedure function returns.
3) Repeat 1) and 2)

Psuedocode to emulate recursion with stack in iterative manner:
```
stack = [(state0)]# Initialize stack with initial state
while stack is not empty:
    frame = top element of the stack
    if condition pop is satisfied:
        # pop to emulate recursive procedure returns
        if condition a solution is satisfied:
            collect current solution
        stack.pop()
        if stack: # there exists a higher level stack frame
            frame = stack.pop()
            backtrack: restore state of the frame
            new_frame = T(frame) # state transition from old to new state
            stack.append(new_frame) # push new state
    else: # push stack to emulate recursive call
        mutate state of the frame
        new_frame = T(frame) # state transition from old to new state
        stack.append(new_frame) # push new state/frame
return result
```

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that the variables used after recursive call contain necessary
information to backtrack(restore states).

The only difference between two version is whether to push adjacent
vertices(states) at one time or one by one.

For DYNAMIC GRAPH, where the edges or vertexes are dynamic, if we want to backtrack (
restoring states after descendants have been visited), we adopt Stack Emulated Recursion
approach.
Otherwise, we need to pass copies of states to avoid backtrack, in order to do
it with the first manner.
