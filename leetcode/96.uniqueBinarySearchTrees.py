Given n, how many structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1...n?

For example,
Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's.

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3

SOLUTION
    Of course, this is a Catalan Number problem.
    Divide and conquer to form state transition relation.

Given n, there are n - 1 nodes to construct except the root one. The we can divide the rest of
nodes by (0, n -1), (1, n - 1), ..., (n - 1, 0), in total n ways. In each way, the number of
unique BST is the number of left subtrees times the right tree's.

1) Dynamic Programming
Recurrence relation:
    f[i] = sum([f[k] * f[i - 1 - k] for k in range(i)])
