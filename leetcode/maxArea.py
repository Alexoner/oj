Container With Most Water

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each
represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn
such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0).
Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container,
such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container.
