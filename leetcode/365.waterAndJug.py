You are given two jugs with capacities x and y litres. There is an infinite amount of
water supply available. You need to determine whether it is possible to measure exactly
z litres using these two jugs.

If z liters of water is measurable, you must have z liters of water contained within one
or both buckets by the end.

Operations allowed:

- Fill any of the jugs completely with water.
- Empty any of the jugs.
- Pour water from one jug into another till the other jug is completely full or the first
jug itself is empty.

Example 1: (From the famous "Die Hard" example)

Input: x = 3, y = 5, z = 4
Output: True
Example 2:

Input: x = 2, y = 6, z = 5
Output: False

SOLUTION
================================================================================

1. Brute force - graph search - breadth first search

Define state:
graph vertex (p, q): volume of water in each jug respectively.

Initial state: (p=0, q=0).
State transition is via graph edges: operations allowed
    Fill: (x, p), (p, y)
    Empty: (0, q), (p, 0)
    Pour: (min(x, p+q), max(0, q-(x-p))), (max(0, p-(y-q)), min(y, p+q)),
Terminal state: z is in {p, q, p+q}.

Complexity:
We need to iterate all possible states that ax+by can represent.


2. Math - greatest common divisor
    If z is measurable, then z = ax + by, which is the form of BÃ©zout's identity.
Denote the greatest common divisor of x and y with d, then there exist such x and y that
d = ax + by, which can be proven by assumption.

Then z must be multiples of d.
