# General Problem Solving Techniques Or Approaches

## Abstraction and Modeling
Convert problems into mathematical/algorithmic MODELS. For example, N Queens,
Course Schedule, Word Ladder II, Integer Replacement are all problems that can be
abstracted into a graphical model.
Sometimes, we need to inspect the problem in different perspectives to find the
lying model.

## Induce
Enumerate test cases/examples, and INDUCE FROM EXAMPLES. This is the reverse 
process of above approach.

## Simplify and Generalize
Some problems may be so complicated that it's not easy to analyze the underlying
model with above approaches. Then we need to SIMPLIFY it. Back to the simplest case, 
and generalize. In this stage, we may ship naive solutions.
Problems: Recursion.

## Optimize From Naive Solutions
Once we figured out naive solutions, figure out the bottleneck in our naive 
algorithm, then try to OPTIMIZE by resolving that.

## Algorithm Brainstorm
To address a specific complexity problem, we can Hit and Try. Run through possible 
solutions with specific time/space complexity, and try.

## Think Out of the Box
