OJ - Mastering problem solving methods, algorithms and data structures
======================================================================

This repository contains solutions to algorithm and data structure problems, mostly from Leetcode.

More important than solutions is HOW TO THINK TO CRACK THE PROBLEM AND FIND THE SOLUTION.

Multiple solutions, thought process to optimize from most naive to the elaborately optimized solution are included.
